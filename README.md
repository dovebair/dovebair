âœ¨ Welcome! âœ¨

I'm Terra, @dovebair. I'm a full stack Ruby programmer looking to expand my skillset. 
I've been working with Ruby since 2016, focusing on supportive roles such as bug fixing and architectural strategy.
I see an unlimited potential in coding to address the "problem" of repetitious work, freeing humans to focus on novel problems. 
I am most interested in working on projects that address human inequities, especially where access to information and each other is the obstacle to success. 
I am interested in working on open source projects. 
I am interested in being hired to assist with your code. 

Please reach out to me at dovebair@gmail.com to discuss how I can be value added to your project ðŸ˜€
